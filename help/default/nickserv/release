Help for RELEASE:

RELEASE removes an enforcer for your nick or
changes the nick of a user that is using your
nick.

Enforcers temporarily prevent all use of a nick.
They are created when someone uses a nickserv 
enforced nick without identifying, or if you use
RELEASE to change the nick of a user.

After changing the nick of a user you may need 
to RELEASE a second time to remove an enforcer.

If you are logged in to the nick, you need not specify
a password, otherwise you have to.

Syntax: RELEASE <nick> [password]

Example:
    /msg &nick& RELEASE smith sesame
